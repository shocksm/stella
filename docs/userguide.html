	<h2 id="started">Getting Started</h2>
	<p>Stella SQL is a database query tool. It allows you to browse and
		query a database using a graphical user interface.</p>


	<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		Java 1.6 or later is required. <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">Download
			Java</a>
	</p>

	<p>You will also need a JDBC driver for the database(s) that you
		want to connect to. Refer to the 'Installing JDBC Drivers' section of
		this document for information on getting and installing other drivers.
	</p>

	<h2 id="installjdbc">Installing JDBC Drivers</h2>
	<p>JDBC drivers can usually be downloaded directly from the
		database vendor's website.</p>

	<p>
		After you have downloaded the driver for your database follow the
		installation instructions as defined in the driver documentation. If
		the downloaded driver has a .jar extension then you probably don't
		have to do anything extra to install it. <br /> Note: It is not
		recommended to install the driver into the Stella installation
		directory as it may get deleted when you upgrade Stella.
	</p>

	<p>Now that you have the JDBC driver follow these steps to
		configure Stella to use it.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Open the 'Driver Manager' screen by selecting the 'Tools'
			main menu item then select 'Driver Manager' from the menu drop down.
		</li>

		<li>Click on the green plus icon in the upper left corner to set
			up a new driver. This will open the Driver Information screen.</li>

		<li>Enter a 'Driver Name' in the first text field. The driver
			name is used to identify this driver so it should at the very least
			identify what kind of database the driver is for.</li>

		<li>Enter the 'Driver Path' by using the 'File' or 'Directory'
			button. If the driver is contained in a .jar file, as is most common,
			then you should click the 'File' button then locate and select the
			.jar file in the file selection dialog. If the driver is installed as
			seperate .class files then you should click on the 'Directory' button
			and select the directory where the class files are located. After the
			driver location is selected the 'Driver Class' combo box should
			automatically populate with at least one driver class. If it does not
			refer to the driver documentation to ensure the driver is installed
			correctly.</li>

		<li>Select the correct 'Driver Class' in the combo box if more
			than one is present. If there are no drive class selections in the
			combo box please refer to the driver documentation to find out what
			you should enter for the driver class.</li>

		<li>In the 'Example JDBC URL' text field enter a example JDBC URL
			as described in the driver documentation. If you would like to use
			the basic setup for a new connection you must enter the example in a
			specific format as described in the 'JDBC URLs and the Basic setting'
			section of this document.</li>

		<li>In the 'Driver Website URL' text field enter the website
			address of the JDBC drivers home page for easy reference back to it
			at a later time.</li>

		<li>Press the 'OK' button to complete the set up of the driver.
			The driver should now show up in the driver list with a green
			checkmark next to it.</li>
	</ol>


	<h2 id="setupjdbc">JDBC URLs and the Basic setting</h2>
	<p>
		On the Driver Information screen JDBC Drivers can be set up to make it
		easier to add and edit connections. To do this the 'Example JDBC URL'
		of the Driver has to identify, or tag, the different parts of the URL
		and the 'Use Basic Driver Parameters' option has to be selected. <br />
		Note: To get to the the Driver Information screen, select the 'Tools'
		main menu, then select 'Driver Manager' from the menu drop down, then
		double click on the driver's name.
	</p>

	<p>To edit the 'Example JDBC URL' to support the basic option you
		will need to locate the different parts of the URL (such as host and
		port) and surround them with with &lt;&gt; (less than and greater than
		signs). The text inside the &lt;&gt; segment will be used to label the
		field on the Connection Configuration screen. These &lt;&gt; segments
		will be replaced by the values entered in the basic Driver Parameters
		section of the Connection Configurtion screen to generate the actual
		JDBC URL that will be used to connect to the database. For example
		&lt;host&gt; will add a 'Host' field to the basic option screen that
		will get replaced with what is entered in the field.</p>

	<p>If you would like to have a default value pre-populated for a
		segment you can add '-defaultvalue' to the segment label inside of the
		&lt;&gt;. For example &lt;host-localhost&gt; will add a 'Host' field
		to the basic option with a default value of 'localhost'.</p>

	<p>If a segment is optional it can be further surrounded by []
		(open brace and close brace). The braces can also enclose any other
		JDBC URL characters that are only needed if the optional segement is
		being used. For example [;databaseName=&lt;database&gt;] indicates
		that the 'database' field is optional and if it is entered then add
		';databaseName=value' to the JDBC URL. If the field is left blank then
		the ';databaseName=' part will not be added to the JDB URL.</p>

	<h3>Example 1</h3>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">Reference URL:</td>
			<td><b>jdbc:oracle:thin:@host:port:sid</b></td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td align="right">Basic Tagged URL:</td>
			<td><b>jdbc:oracle:thin:@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port-1521&gt;:&lt;database
					sid&gt;</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>This example uses the Oracle driver's Refernece URL where 'host'
		is the hostname that Oracle is running on, 'port' is the port number
		it is listening at, and 'sid' is the database service id. The Basic
		Tagged URL will add 3 fields to the Driver Parameters section of the
		Driver Information screen: Host, Port (with a default value of 1521),
		and Database sid.</p>

	<h3>Example 2</h3>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">Reference URL:</td>
			<td><b>jdbc:sqlserver://serverName:port;databaseName=&lt;database&gt;</b>
			</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td align="right">Basic Tagged URL:</td>
			<td><b>jdbc:sqlserver://&lt;host-localhost&gt;:&lt;port-1433&gt;[;databaseName=&lt;database&gt;]</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>This example uses the Microsoft SQL Server driver's Reference
		URL where 'serverName' is the hostname that SQL Server is running on,
		'port' is the port number it is listening at, and 'database' is an
		optional parameter to specifiy which database to default to. The Basic
		Tagged URL will add 3 fields to the Driver Parameters section of the
		Driver Information screen: Host (with a default value of localhost),
		Port (with a default value of 1433), and the optional field Database.
	</p>

	<h2 id="connecting">Connecting to a Database</h2>
	<p>Follow these steps to setup a new database connection and
		connect to it.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Select the 'Connection' item from the main menu bar then
			select 'New' from the menu drop down. This will bring up the
			Connection Configuration screen.</li>

		<li>Enter a 'Connection Alias' in the first text field. The
			connection alias is used to identify the database connection that you
			are setting up so make sure to enter a name that has meaning to you;
			for example, 'Customers - Development' or 'Finance - Production'.</li>

		<li>Select the 'JDBC Driver' in the drop down that matches the
			database you are setting the connection up for. If you do not see
			your database listed then refer to the 'Installing JDBC Drivers'
			section of this document.</li>

		<li>Enter the connection information for your database in the
			'Driver parameters' section. If you are familiar with JDBC driver set
			up you can select the 'Advanced' option to enter the JDBC URL
			directly.</li>

		<li>Enter the 'Username' and 'Password' to use for the connection
			in the 'Logon Credentials' section. If you would prefer to be
			prompted for the username and password when you open the connection
			the select the 'Prompt for Username and/or password' checkbox.</li>

		<li>Click the 'Test' button to make sure the connection is set up
			correctly. If you see a dialog that says 'Connection opened
			successfully' everything is working. Click the 'OK' button to dismiss
			the dialog and then press the 'OK' button on the Connection
			Configuration screen to compelete the set up. If the connection test
			indicated an error then review that everything was entered correctly.
		</li>

		<li>Select the 'Connection' item from the main menu bar then
			select 'Open' from the menu drop down. Select the connection alias
			name that you just set up and press 'OK'. You now have an open
			connection to your database.</li>
	</ol>


	<h2 id="executesql">Executing SQL</h2>
	<p>The SQL Editor is used to enter, edit, and execute SQL
		statements. After connecting to a database as detailed in the
		'Connecting to a Database' section of this document the SQL Editor is
		the text area in the upper right section of the application.</p>

	<p>Type in the SQL statement that you want to execute then press
		the 'Execute Button' (the green arrow button directly above the SQL
		Editor). The results are displayed in the Results Area below the SQL
		Edtior. If you'd prefer to export the results directly to a file press
		the small down arrow next to the 'Execute Button' then select 'Execute
		and export results'.</p>
